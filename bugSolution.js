The solution focuses on improving error handling to provide more informative feedback.  While the underlying cause within Expo might be difficult to fix directly, we can at least provide the user with more context. This is particularly useful because the original error message from `getDocumentAsync` is often not helpful.
```javascript
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker';

async function pickDocument() {
  try {
    const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({});
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error picking document:', error); 
    if (error.message === 'User cancelled') {
       alert('File selection cancelled.');
    } else if (error && error.message) {
      alert(`File selection failed: ${error.message}`);
    } else {
      alert('An unexpected error occurred during file selection. Please try again.');
    }
  }
}
```
This improved error handling provides more specific messages based on various error conditions, improving the user experience and aiding in debugging.
